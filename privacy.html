					<h5>CUBE Privacy Statement</h5>
					<p>This privacy statement applies specifically to the CUBE service. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to CUBE customer support.  </p>  
					<p>CUBE is the sole owner of information collected on this site. We will not use this information in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. CUBE collects information from our users at various points on our website. When a booking is made some customers may leave information and a message. This content is seen by the owner of the booking system and the customer.</p>
					<h5>Registration</h5>
					<p>In order to schedule bookings on this website, a user/subscriber must first complete the registration form.  During registration users are required to give their contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.
					<h5>Billing Details</h5>
					<p>We request information from subscribers on our registration form. Here a subscriber must provide contact information (like name and address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for subscription billing purposes or subscriber/customer billing arrangements. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the subscriber. </p>
					<h5>Session Cookies</h5>
					<p>A session cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user movements whilst using the system.  Our session cookies are also used for security purposes to protect your information. Usage of a session cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the session cookie action simply terminates.  For instance session cookies enable the user to not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the session cookie, they will not be able to use our site.</p>
					<h5>Log Files</h5>
					<p>We use IP addresses for security reasons and to analyse trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use and for working out improvements for our subscribers’ business types. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. </p>
					<h5>Sharing</h5>
					<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our business partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person</p>
					<p>If you are a customer making a booking, CUBE never shares your personal or booking details with anyone except the subscribers with whom you request a booking. Each subscriber only learns the information particular to your bookings with them. The user may be asked to update or add to their details at the time of booking. The purpose of providing this information to the subscriber is to enable them to provide a more personalized experience to customers using our site. However we have no access or control over how subscribers will use this information. </p>
					<h5>Links</h5>
					<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [CUBE] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>
					<h5>Surveys</h5>
					<p>From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys.  Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  </p>
					<h5>Security</h5>
					<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. The system is protected by 256/128 bit SSL encryption at all times.  While on a secured page the lock icon will appear on Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator, Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer.  Alternatively this may also appear as https in the address bar. While we use SSL encryption to protect information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Additionally our servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secured environment.</p>
					<h5>Emails</h5>
					<p>We send all new subscribers a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established subscribers will occasionally receive information on upgrades and services. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.  </p>
					<h5>Site and Service Updates</h5>
					<p>We also occasionally send the user site and service announcement updates. Subscribers are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.</p>
					<h5>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h5>
					<p>If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your post code/zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the subscriber or user information page or by emailing us.</p>
					<h5>Changes</h5>
					<p>CUBE may make changes to its privacy policy from time to time. You should check our privacy policy from time to time to see if we have made any changes to it.</p>
					<h5>As Required By Law</h5>
					<p>We will disclose information about you and your CUBE account when required to do so by federal, state or local law. If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, we may disclose information about you in response to a court or administrative order. We may also disclose information about you and your CUBE account in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process by someone else involved in the dispute, but only if efforts have been made to tell you about the request or to obtain an order protecting the information requested. We may release information if asked to do so by a law enforcement official: In response to a court order, subpoena, warrant, summons or similar process; To identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person; About the victim of a crime if, under certain limited circumstances, we are unable to obtain the person's agreement; About a death we believe may be the result of criminal conduct; About criminal conduct; and In emergency circumstances to report a crime; the location of the crime or victims; or the identity, description or location of the person who committed the crime. We may release information about you to authorized federal officials for intelligence, counterintelligence, and other national security activities authorized by law. You will be liable for any costs incurred by CUBE or its agents or partners in providing this information, in addition to any other reasonable expenses incurred in the carrying out of such requests.</p>
